# A Comparative Study of RNN Architectures for Keyword Spotting on Low-Power Devices

Keyword spotting (KWS) enables many voice-controlled systems and Internet of Things (IoT)
devices by recognizing words in audio streams with high detection rates. However, current
cloud-based methods that rely on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) have limitations,
such as high energy consumption and processing power requirements, making them impractical for
low-power devices. This research aims to address these issues by exploring three models: Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Gated Recurrent Units
(GRU), as potential candidates for keyword detection on low-power microcontrollers. The primary
motivation is that traditional RNNs are power-hungry, so the study investigates various RNN
methodologies specifically developed for low-power consumption. The sequential capabilities of
RNNs, particularly GRUs and LSTMs, are applied to assess their performance and effectiveness for
low-power devices. Through testing and analysis, this report examines the possibilities, advantages,
and disadvantages of these models. It provides informative reviews concerning their accuracy in
keyword detection for low-power applications.
